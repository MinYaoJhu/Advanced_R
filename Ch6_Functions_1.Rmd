# 6 Functions

## 6.1 Introduction
\index{functions}
\index{closures|see {functions}}

If you're reading this book, you've probably already created many R functions and know how to use them to reduce duplication in your code. In this chapter, you'll learn how to turn that informal, working knowledge into more rigorous, theoretical understanding. And while you'll see some interesting tricks and techniques along the way, keep in mind that what you'll learn here will be important for understanding the more advanced topics discussed later in the book.

### Quiz {-}

Answer the following questions to see if you can safely skip this chapter. You can find the answers in Section \@ref(function-answers).

1.  What are the three components of a function?

> Before reading: function content, arguments, defined structure?

> After reading: The three components of a function are its body, arguments, and environment.

2.  What does the following code return?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    x <- 10
    f1 <- function(x) {
      function() {
        x + 10
      }
    }
    f1(1)()
    ```

> Before reading: 11?

> After reading: correct! 11!

3.  How would you usually write this code?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    `+`(1, `*`(2, 3))
    ```

> Before reading: `2*3+1`

> After reading: Correct! You’d normally write it in infix style: 1 + (2 * 3).

4.  How could you make this call easier to read?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    mean(, TRUE, x = c(1:10, NA))
    ```

> Before reading: 

```{r}
x <- c(1:10, NA)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```
> After reading: Correct! Rewriting the call to `mean(c(1:10, NA), na.rm = TRUE)` is easier to understand.

5.  Does the following code throw an error when executed? Why or why not?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    f2 <- function(a, b) {
      a * 10
    }
    f2(10, stop("This is an error!"))
    ```

> Before reading: No error. I think it's because we don't need the second input?

> After reading: Correct! It does not throw an error because the second argument is never used so it’s never evaluated.


6.  What is an infix function? How do you write it? What's a replacement 
    function? How do you write it?
    
> Before reading: In R, most of the functions are “prefix” - meaning that the function name comes before the arguments, which are put between parentheses : `function(a, b)`. With infix functions, the name comes between the arguments: `a function b`. I don't know what's a replacement function.

> After reading: See Sections \@ref(infix-functions) and \@ref(replacement-functions).

> Infix functions get their name from the fact the function name comes inbetween its arguments, and hence have two arguments. R comes with a number of built-in infix operators: `:, ::, :::, $, @, ^, *, /, +, -, >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=, !, &, &&, |, ||, ~, <-, and <<-. You can also create your own infix functions that start and end with %. Base R uses this pattern to define %%, %*%, %/%, %in%, %o%, and %x%.`

> Replacement functions act like they modify their arguments in place, and have the special name xxx<-. They must have arguments named x and value, and must return the modified object. For example, the following function modifies the second element of a vector:

```{r}
`second<-` <- function(x, value) {
  x[2] <- value
  x
}
```

7.  How do you ensure that cleanup action occurs regardless of how a function 
    exits?
    
> Before reading: on.exit()?

> After reading: correct! You use `on.exit()`; see Section \@ref(on-exit) for details.

> To ensure that these changes are undone and that the global state is restored no matter how a function exits, use on.exit() to set up an exit handler. The following simple example shows that the exit handler is run regardless of whether the function exits normally or with an error.

### Outline {-}

* Section \@ref(function-fundamentals) describes the basics of creating a 
  function, the three main components of a function, and the exception
  to many function rules: primitive functions (which are implemented in C, not 
  R).

* Section \@ref(function-composition) discusses the strengths and weaknesses
  of the three forms of function composition commonly used in R code.

* Section \@ref(lexical-scoping) shows you how R finds the value associated
  with a given name, i.e. the rules of lexical scoping.

* Section \@ref(lazy-evaluation) is devoted to an important property of 
  function arguments: they are only evaluated when used for the first time.

* Section \@ref(fun-dot-dot-dot) discusses the special `...` argument, which
  allows you to pass on extra arguments to another function.

* Section \@ref(exiting-a-function) discusses the two primary ways that a
  function can exit, and how to define an exit handler, code that is run on
  exit, regardless of what triggers it.
  
* Section \@ref(function-forms) shows you the various ways in which R 
  disguises ordinary function calls, and how you can use the standard prefix
  form to better understand what's going on.

## 6.2 Function fundamentals

To understand functions in R you need to internalise two important ideas:

* Functions can be broken down into three components: arguments, body, and environment.

There are exceptions to every rule, and in this case, there is a small selection of "primitive" base functions that are implemented purely in C.

* Functions are objects, just as vectors are objects.

### 6.2.1 Function components {#fun-components}
\index{functions!body} 
\indexc{body()} 
\index{functions!formals} 
\index{arguments!formal} 
\indexc{formals()} 
\index{functions!environment}
\index{environments!of a function}
\indexc{srcref}

A function has three parts: 

* The `formals()`, the list of arguments that control how you call the function.
  
* The `body()`, the code inside the function.

* The `environment()`, the data structure that determines how the function finds 
the values associated with the names.

While the formals and body are specified explicitly when you create a function, the environment is specified implicitly, based on _where_ you defined the function. The function environment always exists, but it is only printed when the function isn't defined in the global environment.

```{r}
f02 <- function(x, y) {
  # A comment
  x + y
}

formals(f02)

body(f02)

environment(f02)
```

```{r}
    x <- 10
    f1 <- function(x) {
      function() {
        x + 10
      }
    }
    f1(1)()
```

```{r}
onePlusTen <- f1(1)
tenPlusTen <- f1(10)

onePlusTen
tenPlusTen
```


I'll draw functions as in the following diagram. The black dot on the left is the environment. The two blocks to the right are the function arguments. I won't draw the body, because it's usually large, and doesn't help you understand the shape of the function.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/functions/components.png")
```

Like all objects in R, functions can also possess any number of additional `attributes()`. One attribute used by base R is `srcref`, short for source reference. It points to the source code used to create the function. The `srcref` is used for printing because, unlike `body()`, it contains code comments and other formatting.  

```{r}
attr(f02, "srcref")
```

### 6.2.2 Primitive functions
\index{primitive functions} 
\index{functions!primitive} 
\indexc{.Primitive()}

There is one exception to the rule that a function has three components. Primitive functions, like `sum()` and `[`, call C code directly. 

```{r}
sum
`[`
```

They have either type `builtin` or type `special`.

```{r}
typeof(sum)
typeof(`[`)
```

These functions exist primarily in C, not R, so their `formals()`, `body()`, and `environment()` are all `NULL`:  

```{r}
formals(sum)
body(sum)
environment(sum)
```

Primitive functions are only found in the base package. While they have certain performance advantages, this benefit comes at a price: they are harder to write. For this reason, R-core generally avoids creating them unless there is no other option.

<!-- HW: mention internal functions here too? Cross-reference to perf example -->

### 6.2.3 First-class functions {#first-class-functions}
\index{functions!anonymous} 
\index{anonymous functions}

It's very important to understand that R functions are objects in their own right, a language property often called "first-class functions". Unlike in many other languages, there is no special syntax for defining and naming a function: you simply create a function object (with `function`) and bind it to a name with `<-`:

```{r}
f01 <- function(x) {
  sin(1 / x ^ 2)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/functions/first-class.png")
```

While you almost always create a function and then bind it to a name, the binding step is not compulsory. If you choose not to give a function a name, you get an __anonymous function__. This is useful when it's not worth the effort to figure out a name:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lapply(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))
Filter(function(x) !is.numeric(x), mtcars)
integrate(function(x) sin(x) ^ 2, 0, pi)
```

A final option is to put functions in a list:

```{r}
funs <- list(
  half = function(x) x / 2,
  double = function(x) x * 2
)

funs$double(10)
```

In R, you'll often see functions called __closures__. This name reflects the fact that R functions capture, or enclose, their environments, which you'll learn more about in Section \@ref(function-environments).

### 6.2.4 Invoking a function
\indexc{do.call()}

You normally call a function by placing its arguments, wrapped in parentheses, after its name: `mean(1:10, na.rm = TRUE)`. But what happens if you have the arguments already in a data structure?

```{r}
args <- list(1:10, na.rm = TRUE)
```

You can instead use `do.call()`: it has two arguments. The function to call, and a list containing the function arguments:

```{r}
do.call(mean, args)
```

We'll come back to this idea in Section \@ref(tidy-dots).

### 6.2.5 Exercises

1. Given a name, like `"mean"`, `match.fun()` lets you find a function. 
   Given a function, can you find its name? Why doesn't that make sense in R?
   
```{r}
?match.fun()
```

> Extract a Function Specified by Name.
Description: When called inside functions that take a function as argument, extract the desired function object while avoiding undesired matching to objects of other types.

```{r}
match.fun(mean)
```

> A function can have more than one name.

> In R there is no one-to-one mapping between functions and names. A name always points to a single object, but an object may have zero, one or many names.

> Besides that, there are obviously ways to search for function names. However, to be sure to find the right one(s), you should not only compare the code (body) but also the arguments (formals) and the creation environment. As formals(), body() and environment() all return NULL for primitive functions, the easiest way to check if two functions are exactly equal is just to use identical().

```{r}
match.fun(anova)
```

```{r}
library(car)
match.fun(Anova)
```

```{r}
identical(anova, Anova)
```


2.  It's possible (although typically not useful) to call an anonymous function. Which of the two approaches below is correct? Why?

```{r, result = "hide"}
function(x) 3()
(function(x) 3)()
```

> `(function(x) 3)()` is correct.

> The anonymous function function(x) 3 is surrounded by a pair of parentheses before it is called by (). These extra parentheses separate the function call from the anonymous function’s body. Without them a function with the invalid body 3() is returned, which throws an error when we call it. This is easier to see if we name the function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
function1 <- function(x) 3()
function1()
# Error in function1() : attempt to apply non-function
```

3. A good rule of thumb is that an anonymous function should fit on one line 
   and shouldn't need to use `{}`. Review your code. Where could you have 
   used an anonymous function instead of a named function? Where should you 
   have used a named function instead of an anonymous function?

```{r}
sapply(1:2, function(x) x + 1L)
```
> The use of anonymous functions allows concise and elegant code in certain situations. However, they miss a descriptive name and when re-reading the code, it can take a while to figure out what they do. That’s why it’s helpful to give long and complex functions a descriptive name.



4.  What function allows you to tell if an object is a function? What function
    allows you to tell if a function is a primitive function?
    
```{r}
?is.function() 
?is.primitive()
```

> Use is.function(x): Checks whether its argument is a function.

> Use is.primitive(x): Checks whether its argument is a primitive function.

> There is one exception to the rule that a function has three components. Primitive functions, like sum() and [, call C code directly. These functions exist primarily in C, not R, so their formals(), body(), and environment() are all NULL. Primitive functions are only found in the base package. While they have certain performance advantages, this benefit comes at a price: they are harder to write. For this reason, R-core generally avoids creating them unless there is no other option. 6.2.2



5.  This code makes a list of all functions in the base package. 
    
```{r}
objs <- mget(ls("package:base", all = TRUE), inherits = TRUE)
funs <- Filter(is.function, objs) #

#?mget
```
    
> Return the Value of a Named Object: Search by name for an object (get) or zero or more objects (mget).

mget(x, envir = as.environment(-1), mode = "any", ifnotfound,
     inherits = FALSE)
    
```{r}
str(funs)
```
    Use it to answer the following questions:

    a. Which base function has the most arguments?

```{r}
library(purrr)

#?map
#?map_int

n_args <- funs %>% 
  map(formals) %>%
  map_int(length)
```

> map() always returns a list. 
> map_lgl(), map_int(), map_dbl() and map_chr() return an atomic vector of the indicated type (or die trying).

```{r}
str(n_args)
head(n_args)
```


```{r}
n_args %>% 
  which.max()
```

another method:

```{r}
n_args %>% 
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
  head()
```


other method:

```{r}
fun.args <- sapply(funs, function(x) length(formals(x))) 

names(funs)[which.max(fun.args)] 
```
> sapply is a user-friendly version and wrapper of lapply by default returning a vector, matrix or, if simplify = "array", an array if appropriate, by applying simplify2array(). sapply(x, f, simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = FALSE) is the same as lapply(x, f).


    b. How many base functions have no arguments? What's special about those
       functions?
       
```{r}
length(n_args)
sum(n_args == 0)
```
> However, this over counts because formals() returns NULL for primitive functions, and length(NULL) is 0. To fix this, we can first remove the primitive functions:


```{r}
n_args2 <- funs %>% 
  discard(is.primitive) %>% 
  map(formals) %>%
  map_int(length)

sum(n_args2 == 0)
```

> most of the functions with no arguments are actually primitive functions.
       
    c. How could you adapt the code to find all primitive functions?
    
```{r}
objs <- mget(ls("package:base", all = TRUE), inherits = TRUE)
pri <- Filter(is.primitive, objs)
# str(pri)
length(pri)
```


6. What are the three important components of a function?

> The three important components of a function are its body, arguments, and environment.

7. When does printing a function not show the environment it was created in?

> 1. When it's a primitive function.

> 2. When the function is defined in the global environment.

> Primitive functions and functions created in the global environment do not print their environment.

## 6.3 Function composition {#function-composition}
\index{functions!composition}
\indexc{\%>\%}
\index{magrittr|see {\texttt{\%>\%}}}
\index{piping|see {\texttt{\%>\%}}}

Base R provides two ways to compose multiple function calls. For example, imagine you want to compute the population standard deviation using `sqrt()` and `mean()` as building blocks:

```{r}
square <- function(x) x^2
deviation <- function(x) x - mean(x)
```

You either nest the function calls:

```{r}
x <- runif(100)

sqrt(mean(square(deviation(x))))
```

Or you save the intermediate results as variables:

```{r}
out <- deviation(x)
out <- square(out)
out <- mean(out)
out <- sqrt(out)
out
```

The magrittr package [@magrittr] provides a third option: the binary operator `%>%`, which is called the pipe and is pronounced as "and then".

```{r}
library(magrittr)

x %>%
  deviation() %>%
  square() %>%
  mean() %>%
  sqrt()
```

`x %>% f()` is equivalent to `f(x)`; `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`. The pipe allows you to focus on the high-level composition of functions rather than the low-level flow of data; the focus is on what's being done (the verbs), rather than on what's being modified (the nouns). This style is common in Haskell and F#, the main inspiration for magrittr, and is the default style in stack based programming languages like Forth and Factor. 

Each of the three options has its own strengths and weaknesses:

* Nesting, `f(g(x))`, is concise, and well suited for short sequences. But
  longer sequences are hard to read because they are read inside out and
  right to left. As a result, arguments can get spread out over long distances
  creating the [Dagwood
  sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagwood_sandwich) problem.

* Intermediate objects, `y <- f(x); g(y)`, requires you to name intermediate
  objects. This is a strength when objects are important, but a weakness when
  values are truly intermediate.

* Piping, `x %>% f() %>% g()`, allows you to read code in straightforward
  left-to-right fashion and doesn't require you to name intermediate objects.
  But you can only use it with linear sequences of transformations of a single
  object. It also requires an additional third party package and assumes that
  the reader understands piping.

Most code will use a combination of all three styles. Piping is more common in data analysis code, as much of an analysis consists of a sequence of transformations of an object (like a data frame or plot). I tend to use piping infrequently in packages; not because it is a bad idea, but because it's often a less natural fit.

## 6.4 Lexical scoping {#lexical-scoping}
\index{scoping!lexical}

In Chapter \@ref(names-values), we discussed assignment, the act of binding a name to a value. Here we'll discuss __scoping__, the act of finding the value associated with a name.

The basic rules of scoping are quite intuitive, and you've probably already internalised them, even if you never explicitly studied them. For example, what will the following code return, 10 or 20?[^answer1]

[^answer1]: I'll "hide" the answers to these challenges in the footnotes. Try solving them before looking at the answer; this will help you to better remember the correct answer. In this case, `g01()` will return `20`.

```{r, results = "hide"}
x <- 10
g01 <- function() {
  x <- 20
  x
}

g01()
```

In this section, you'll learn the formal rules of scoping as well as some of its more subtle details. A deeper understanding of scoping will help you to use more advanced functional programming tools, and eventually, even to write tools that translate R code into other languages.

R uses __lexical scoping__[^dyn-scope]: it looks up the values of names based on how a function is defined, not how it is called. "Lexical" here is not the English adjective that means relating to words or a vocabulary. It's a technical CS term that tells us that the scoping rules use a parse-time, rather than a run-time structure. 

R's lexical scoping follows four primary rules:

* Name masking
* Functions versus variables
* A fresh start
* Dynamic lookup

[^dyn-scope]: Functions that automatically quote one or more arguments can override the default scoping rules to implement other varieties of scoping. You'll learn more about that in Chapter \@ref(evaluation).

### 6.4.1 Name masking
\index{functions!scoping}

The basic principle of lexical scoping is that names defined inside a function mask names defined outside a function. This is illustrated in the following example.

```{r}
x <- 10
y <- 20
g02 <- function() {
  x <- 1
  y <- 2
  c(x, y)
}
g02()
```

If a name isn't defined inside a function, R looks one level up.

```{r}
x <- 2
g03 <- function() {
  y <- 1
  c(x, y)
}
g03()

# And this doesn't change the previous value of y
y
```

The same rules apply if a function is defined inside another function. First, R looks inside the current function. Then, it looks where that function was defined (and so on, all the way up to the global environment). Finally, it looks in other loaded packages. 

Run the following code in your head, then confirm the result by running the code.[^answer2]

[^answer2]: `g04()` returns `c(1, 2, 3)`.

```{r, results = "hide"}
x <- 1
g04 <- function() {
  y <- 2
  i <- function() {
    z <- 3
    c(x, y, z)
  }
  i()
}
g04()
```

The same rules also apply to functions created by other functions, which I call manufactured functions, the topic of Chapter \@ref(function-factories). 

### 6.4.2 Functions versus variables

In R, functions are ordinary objects. This means the scoping rules described above also apply to functions:

```{r}
g07 <- function(x) x + 1
g08 <- function() {
  g07 <- function(x) x + 100
  g07(10)
}
g08()
```

However, when a function and a non-function share the same name (they must, of course, reside in different environments), applying these rules gets a little more complicated. When you use a name in a function call, R ignores non-function objects when looking for that value. For example, in the code below, `g09` takes on two different values:

```{r}
g09 <- function(x) x + 100
g10 <- function() {
  g09 <- 10
  g09(g09)
}
g10()
```

For the record, using the same name for different things is confusing and best avoided!

### 6.4.3 A fresh start {#fresh-start}

What happens to values between invocations of a function? Consider the example below. What will happen the first time you run this function? What will happen the second time?[^answer4] (If you haven't seen `exists()` before, it returns `TRUE` if there's a variable with that name and returns `FALSE` if not.)

[^answer4]: `g11()` returns `1` every time it's called.

```{r, results = "hide"}
g11 <- function() {
  if (!exists("a")) {
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a
}

g11()
g11()
```

You might be surprised that `g11()` always returns the same value. This happens because every time a function is called a new environment is created to host its execution. This means that a function has no way to tell what happened the last time it was run; each invocation is completely independent. We'll see some ways to get around this in Section \@ref(stateful-funs).

### 6.4.4 Dynamic lookup
\indexc{findGlobals()}

Lexical scoping determines where, but not when to look for values. R looks for values when the function is run, not when the function is created. Together, these two properties tell us that the output of a function can differ depending on the objects outside the function's environment:

```{r}
g12 <- function() x + 1
x <- 15
g12()

x <- 20
g12()
```

This behaviour can be quite annoying. If you make a spelling mistake in your code, you won't get an error message when you create the function. And depending on the variables defined in the global environment, you might not even get an error message when you run the function. 

To detect this problem, use `codetools::findGlobals()`. This function lists all the external dependencies (unbound symbols) within a function:

```{r}
codetools::findGlobals(g12)
```

To solve this problem, you can manually change the function's environment to the `emptyenv()`, an environment which contains nothing:

```{r, error = TRUE}
environment(g12) <- emptyenv()
#g12()
#Error in x + 1 : could not find function "+"
```

The problem and its solution reveal why this seemingly undesirable behaviour exists: R relies on lexical scoping to find _everything_, from the obvious, like `mean()`, to the less obvious, like `+` or even `{`. This gives R's scoping rules a rather beautiful simplicity.

### 6.4.5 Exercises

1. What does the following code return? Why? Describe how each of the three
   `c`'s is interpreted.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    c <- 10
    c(c = c)
    ```

> the `c()` represents the *c: Combine Values into a Vector or List* function.
> the `c=` represents a name.
> the `=c` represents a value, 10.

2. What are the four principles that govern how R looks for values?

> R’s lexical scoping follows four primary rules:

> 1. Name masking.

The basic principle of lexical scoping is that names defined inside a function mask names defined outside a function. 

> 2. Functions versus variables.

when a function and a non-function share the same name (they must, of course, reside in different environments), applying these rules gets a little more complicated. When you use a name in a function call, R ignores non-function objects when looking for that value. 

> 3. A fresh start

Every time a function is called a new environment is created to host its execution. This means that a function has no way to tell what happened the last time it was run; each invocation is completely independent. 

> 4. Dynamic lookup

Lexical scoping determines where, but not when to look for values. R looks for values when the function is run, not when the function is created. Together, these two properties tell us that the output of a function can differ depending on the objects outside the function’s environment.

3. What does the following function return? Make a prediction before 
   running the code yourself.

    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    f <- function(x) {
      f <- function(x) {
        f <- function() {
          x ^ 2
        }
        f() + 1
      }
      f(x) * 2
    }
    f(10)
    ```

> 202. Correct!

> The innermost f() is called last, though it is the first function to return a value. Therefore, the order of the calculation passes “from the inside to the outside” and the function returns ((10 ^ 2) + 1) * 2 = 202.

## 6.5 Lazy evaluation {#lazy-evaluation}
\index{evaluation!lazy|see {lazy evaluation}} 
\index{lazy evaluation} 
\index{functions!lazy evaluation}

In R, function arguments are __lazily evaluated__: they're only evaluated if accessed. For example, this code doesn't generate an error because `x` is never used:

```{r}
h01 <- function(x) {
  10
}
h01(stop("This is an error!"))
```

This is an important feature because it allows you to do things like include potentially expensive computations in function arguments that will only be evaluated if needed.

### 6.5.1 Promises
\index{promises}
\index{thunks|see {promises}}

Lazy evaluation is powered by a data structure called a __promise__, or (less commonly) a thunk. It's one of the features that makes R such an interesting programming language (we'll return to promises again in Section \@ref(quosures)).

A promise has three components: 

*   An expression, like `x + y`, which gives rise to the delayed computation.

*   An environment where the expression should be evaluated, i.e. the
    environment where the function is called. This makes sure that the
    following function returns 11, not 101:
    
    ```{r}
    y <- 10
    h02 <- function(x) {
      y <- 100
      x + 1
    }
    
    h02(y)
    ```
    
    This also means that when you do assignment inside a call to a function,
    the variable is bound outside of the function, not inside of it.
    
    ```{r}
    h02(y <- 1000)
    y
    ```
    
*   A value, which is computed and cached the first time a promise is 
    accessed when the expression is evaluated in the specified environment.
    This ensures that the promise is evaluated at most once, and is why you
    only see "Calculating..." printed once in the following example.
    
    ```{r}
    double <- function(x) { 
      message("Calculating...")
      x * 2
    }
    
    h03 <- function(x) {
      c(x, x)
    }
    
    h03(double(20))
    ```

You cannot manipulate promises with R code. Promises are like a quantum state: any attempt to inspect them with R code will force an immediate evaluation, making the promise disappear. Later, in Section \@ref(quosures), you'll learn about quosures, which convert promises into an R object where you can easily inspect the expression and the environment.


### 6.5.2 Default arguments
\index{functions!default values}

Thanks to lazy evaluation, default values can be defined in terms of other arguments, or even in terms of variables defined later in the function:

```{r}
h04 <- function(x = 1, y = x * 2, z = a + b) {
  a <- 10
  b <- 100
  
  c(x, y, z)
}

h04()
```

Many base R functions use this technique, but I don't recommend it. It makes the code harder to understand: to predict _what_ will be returned, you need to know the exact order in which default arguments are evaluated.

The evaluation environment is slightly different for default and user supplied arguments, as default arguments are evaluated inside the function. This means that seemingly identical calls can yield different results. It's easiest to see this with an extreme example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
h05 <- function(x = ls()) {
  a <- 1
  x
}

# ls() evaluated inside h05:
h05()
#> [1] "a" "x"

# ls() evaluated in global environment:
h05(ls())
#> [1] "h05"

env <- ls()
h05(env)
```


### 6.5.3 Missing arguments
\index{missing arguments!missing@\texttt{missing()}}
\indexc{\%\textbar\textbar\%}

To determine if an argument's value comes from the user or from a default, you can use `missing()`:

```{r}
h06 <- function(x = 10) {
  list(missing(x), x)
}
str(h06())
str(h06(10))
```

`missing()` is best used sparingly, however. Take `sample()`, for example. How many arguments are required?

```{r}
args(sample)
```
 
It looks like both `x` and `size` are required, but if `size` is not supplied, `sample()` uses `missing()` to provide a default. If I were to rewrite sample, I'd use an explicit `NULL` to indicate that `size` is not required but can be supplied:

```{r}
sample <- function(x, size = NULL, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL) {
  if (is.null(size)) {
    size <- length(x)
  }
  
  x[sample.int(length(x), size, replace = replace, prob = prob)]
}
```

With the binary pattern created by the `%||%` infix function, which uses the left side if it's not `NULL` and the right side otherwise, we can further simplify `sample()`:
\indexc{NULL}

```{r}
`%||%` <- function(lhs, rhs) {
  if (!is.null(lhs)) {
    lhs
  } else {
    rhs
  }
}

sample <- function(x, size = NULL, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL) {
  size <- size %||% length(x)
  x[sample.int(length(x), size, replace = replace, prob = prob)]
}
```

Because of lazy evaluation, you don't need to worry about unnecessary computation: the right side of `%||%` will only be evaluated if the left side is `NULL`.

### 6.5.4 Exercises

1.  What important property of `&&` makes `x_ok()` work?

    ```{r}
    x_ok <- function(x) {
      !is.null(x) && length(x) == 1 && x > 0
    }
    
    x_ok(NULL)
    x_ok(1)
    x_ok(1:3)
    ```

```{r}
FALSE & NA
```


```{r}
?`&&`
```

> && does not perform elementwise comparisons; instead it uses the first element of each value only. 

> In summary: && short-circuits which means that if the left-hand side is FALSE it doesn’t evaluate the right-hand side (because it doesn’t matter). Similarly, if the left-hand side of || is TRUE it doesn’t evaluate the right-hand side.

> && does not perform elementwise comparisons; instead it uses the first element of each value only. It also uses lazy evaluation, in the sense that evaluation “proceeds only until the result is determined.”

> This means that the RHS of && won’t be evaluated if the LHS already determines the outcome of the comparison (e.g. evaluate to FALSE). This behaviour is also known as “short-circuiting.”

What is different with this code? Why is this behaviour undesirable here?
    
    ```{r}
    x_ok <- function(x) {
      !is.null(x) & length(x) == 1 & x > 0
    }
    
    x_ok(NULL)
    x_ok(1)
    x_ok(1:3)
    ```

 `&` evaluate only first one, `&&` evaluate both
 However, False > NA > True
 
 the second version is not

```{r}
length(NULL) == 1
NULL > 0
```

    
2.  What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?

    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    f2 <- function(x = z) {
      z <- 100
      x
    }
    f2()
    ```

> 100. Lazy evaluation, Default arguments. `x = z`can be supplied inside the function

> The function returns 100. The default argument (x = z) gets lazily evaluated within the function environment when x gets accessed. At this time z has already been bound to the value 100. The illustrated principle here is lazy evaluation.

3.  What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?
  
    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    y <- 10
    f1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) {
      c(x, y)
    }
    f1()
    y
    ```
```{r}
f1(x = 2)
f1(y = 3)

```


> f1() returns c(2, 1)

> lexical scoping, name masking

4.  In `hist()`, the default value of `xlim` is `range(breaks)`, the default 
    value for `breaks` is `"Sturges"`, and

    ```{r}
    range("Sturges")
    ```
    
    Explain how `hist()` works to get a correct `xlim` value.

```{r}
?range
```

> range returns a vector containing the minimum and maximum of all the given arguments.

```{r}
range(1:10)
```

```{r}
?hist()
```

> The generic function hist computes a histogram of the given data values.

## Default S3 method:
hist(x, breaks = "Sturges",
     freq = NULL, probability = !freq,
     include.lowest = TRUE, right = TRUE, fuzz = 1e-7,
     density = NULL, angle = 45, col = "lightgray", border = NULL,
     main = paste("Histogram of" , xname),
     xlim = range(breaks), ylim = NULL,
     xlab = xname, ylab,
     axes = TRUE, plot = TRUE, labels = FALSE,
     nclass = NULL, warn.unused = TRUE, ...)

breaks = "Sturges" get the number


nclass {grDevices}

Compute the Number of Classes for a Histogram

Description
Compute the number of classes for a histogram, notably hist().

Usage
nclass.Sturges(x)
nclass.scott(x)
nclass.FD(x, digits = 5)


5.  Explain why this function works. Why is it confusing?

    ```{r}
    show_time <- function(x = stop("Error!")) {
      stop <- function(...) Sys.time()
      print(x)
    }
    show_time()
    ```

```{r}
print(Sys.time())
```



> Functions can have a special argument ... (pronounced dot-dot-dot). With it, a function can take any number of additional arguments.

6.  How many arguments are required when calling `library()`?

```{r}
?library()
```

```{r}
formals(library)
length(formals(library))
```

> 0

> library() doesn’t require any arguments. 

```{r}
#print.libraryIQR()
```
